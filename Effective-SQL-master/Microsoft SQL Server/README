REMINDER:
In SQL Server, use CREATE DATABASE to create a new database that contains tables
and other objects (Views, Functions, etc.).  Use CREATE SCHEMA to create a named
subset of tables and other objects with a database.  This allows you to define 
security for a subset of objects within a database.
