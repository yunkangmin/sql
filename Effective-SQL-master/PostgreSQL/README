REMINDER:
Use CREATE DATABASE to create a new container for tables and other objects.
USE CREATE SCHEMA to create a subset container for tables and other objects 
within the current or default database.  We chose to use CREATE SCHEMA to make 
it possible to point to the set of tables we need to use for a particular 
batch of SQL commands in the listings using the SET search_path within the SQL script.
