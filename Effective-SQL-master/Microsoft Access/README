REMINDER:
Microsoft Office Access supports neither CREATE DATABASE nor CREATE SCHEMA.
To create a new database file (that contains tables and other objects),
you must use the Access user interface, or the CreateDatabase method of
the Workspace object in VBA code using Data Access Objecs (DAO), or the
CreateObject("ADOX.Catalog") and Catalog.Create commands in VBA code 
using Access Database Objects Extensions (ADOX).
