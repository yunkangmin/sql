REMINDER:
In Oracle, use CREATE USER to create a new container for application tables.  Use
CREATE DATABASE to create a new instance of the Oracle system. Oracle recognizes 
the CREATE SCHEMA command but it means to create objects within an existing schema. 
New schema can only be created with CREATE USER command.

NOTE:
All CREATE USER command assumes that your Oracle installation has defined USERS and
TEMP for default tablespace and temporary tablespace. If neither exist in your 
installation, you must adjust the name of the tablespaces for the CREATE USER
command to succeed.
